## Firebase Configuration
Replace the placeholder in `firebase-config.js` with your Firebase project configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};


//Firebase Connection Rules 
// Initialize Firebase
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
firebase.analytics();

{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    }
  }
}

This version adds a detailed explanation of database rules and includes actionable items for future improvements. Let me know if there’s anything else to modify!
